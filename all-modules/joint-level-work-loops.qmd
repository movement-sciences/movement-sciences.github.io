You can include links to files that are stored on the Github repo:

[Download demo MATLAB code](..//resources/example/HelloWorld.m)

[Download a PDF](..//resources/example/How%20to%20read%20a%20scientific%20paper.pdf)

We can include Matlab script, though it won't show outputs:

``` matlab
x = 1
y = 2
z = x+y
z
```

This is an example of an R script. It will print the output:

```{r}
x=1
y=2
z = x+y
z
```
