The **Integrative Movement Sciences Institute (IMSI)** is a National Science Foundation (NSF) Biology Integration Institute dedicated to advancing the understanding of muscular control of movement across organizational scales—from molecular to organismal and ecological.

Our team of leading researchers from universities across the United States is creating a free, fully online course designed to share the excitement of movement science. The course is organized into individual modules covering a variety of movement science topics, which can be explored on their own or combined into curated learning pathways. You can browse modules to find those that spark your curiosity, or follow a recommended pathway to dive deeper into a specific area of the field.
